# **QA WORKFLOW**

I am [Alexandru Cercel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandru-mihai-cercel-b49881180), student of the [Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/). This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer [Ricard Pillosu](https://es.linkedin.com/in/ricardpillosu).



# What is QA Workflow

It is a step-by-step workflow on how to perform tasks that "ensure" the quality of the project from the beginning to the end of the task. During the development of the game the workflow changes with the different phases that there are, therefore the tasks and priorities change as we go forward and we are asked for different feedback based on the priorities of that development phase.

To reduce errors and minimize bugs, different tools are used to help us carry out our work. The organization is very important since we have to be constantly in contact with our team and provide quality feedback so that we can polish every feature as much as possible.

# What is the typical workflow of a major video game?

**Proposal phase -**  The team brainstorms and creates a high level design doc to pitch the concept in search of funding.

**Gate to preproduction** - The team creates a fuller and more technical project description, they solve some tech issues, get some concept art made, schedules projections and everything els that is needed

**Preproduction** - A very agile, exploratory phase of development. The goals are to solve all the outstanding questions, create asset pipelines, find the fun and produce a “vertical slice”  that is just a few minutes of finished  gameplay.

**Production** - Now that you know how to make content, the team gets really bulked up, the schedule gets firmer and lots of implementation starts. 

**Testing** - Traditionally, we made alpha versions (broken, incomplete, but winnable if only one way), beta versions (complete but buggy) and gold master candidates (we think this is the finished game - QA try to prove otherwise). Now, the versions are more incremental and can even continue to improve post launch. Still, the process is the same - clean, careful, numbered builds that go to QA for a full shakedown and hopefully a sign-off for public release. 

**Release support** - The newly released game is beeing watched and looking forward to make a patch to solve bugs and other problems that might be founded during the release.
